Data overview
=======================================
<div style="float: left; width: 95%;">

+ Survey description: 684 respondents, answering over 200 questions having to do with their feelings and opinions on Seattle Reign and the matches. 

    - The responses were collected on sliding scales, like from -3 to 3 on satisfaction or from 1 - 7 on their loyalty to the
    team
    - I am basing my findings on these 684 respondents, this a reasonable sample size but does not account for all fans.
    
+ What I am looking to do with this data                           

    - I found Two Key Changes to potentially impact satisfaction, Interest and Viewership of our fans.
    - They revolve around the coach being so special to the fans and the popularity of TV & Twitter viewership
    - With these changes I hope not only Interest and Viewership will increase, but Attendance and Purchasing.

Quick Facts
=======================================
<div style="float: left; width: 95%;">
+ Respondents

    - The respondents were mainly white women between the age of 30 - 50 and more than half of our respondents made over
    $80,000 
    - Our Respondents alone checked our media sites over 4,000 times a week last season
    - Satisfaction and Interest in the team is very high in respondents, but I have some recommendations to potentially
    increase that.
    - I did notice the significant drop in first time attendance in 2016, and only 30% intend to get season tickets for 2017
    - This could be due to a multitude of reasons I will dive into here, as well as in our memo and dashboard.
    - The most preferred game time is Wednesday Evening, Over 500 respondents want Wednesday Evening Matches.

What Impacts Fan Loyalty?
=======================================
Recommendation #1: Increasing Interest and Satisfaction: Involve the coach more, adjust accommodations slightly

+ Fans answered questions rating what parts of the team and sport that they felt most connected to

    - The respondents all really enjoy womans soccer in general as well as the league Reign is in
    - The top three important factors though were the coach, the skill of the game, and chance to escape from normal life.
    - The team should do what it can to involve the coach more in interviews, ad campaigns, and general promotions
    - Satisfaction wise fans are pleased with Accommodations, only negative feed back was on variety and drink times

Viewership
=======================================
<div style="float: left; width: 95%;">
Recommendation #2: Increase Viewership, and Attendance With National TV presence and Focus on Twitter

+ I also saw a very large demand from the majority of respondents asking for National TV coverage.

    - I have over 450 respondents out of 684 that currently watch the Team on TV, but 590 fans want National Coverage

![](InterestInEachViewership.png){width=780px}        ![](FutureAttendanceViewership.png){width=780px}

+ This is really important as this will help us with our future attendance: Post lots of information on twitter on and about the team, league and coach, use Ticket Discounts with these users
    


</div>

Bringing It All Together
=======================================
<div style="float: left; width: 95%;">
What Does Acting On These Recomendations Look Like?

+ Involve the coach more, maybe diversify our options on food offered

    - The Fans love the skill of the players and the sport itself
    - However I can increase the media presence of the coach
    - As stated the respondents are as a whole very satisfied with the accomadations.
    - It may be difficult to decrease delivery time on drinks without hiring more staff
    - However, increasing our general variety of foods offered should be straight forward.
+ National TV presence and Focus on Twitter

    - We should do what we can to get on National Television, as over 80% of respondents want that.
    - TV Viewers also end up going to more games than most viewerships, which will increase ticket sales.
    - I know that our Twitter Users are the most inclined to go to games, using ticket discounts will increase the                effectiveness of this platform.
    - Increase season ticket sales up from 30%

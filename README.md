# Survey-Data-Analysis-
Analysis of large variable count survey data, with data cleaning, EDA, visuals and recommendations in R. Please read the README.
This project works through the process of massive data cleaning as well as Exploratory Data Analysis in a Technical Appendix, from which I gather 6 recommendations along with visuals to support the recommendations. I then built a presentation, dashboard and memo to deliver those recommendations. In the TA the easy way to read the important visuals is to knit the file (ctrl+shift+k) and then use the table of contents to skip the first few sections of data tidying. The dashboard uses interactive R code to portray my recommendations. It can be accessed here: https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/reports/12278ad4-a716-4f48-9c32-f22570953d02?ctid=bc10e052-b01c-4849-9967-ee7ec74fc9d8&pbi_source=linkShare  or you can view what it looks like in the attached image. The CSV file included as well is the raw data I had, and should be easy to import into the R environment and run.
